"""Automated checks of the extra copy (KH2COOP_EXTRA_COPY=1) on a bench pair, one scenario at a time.

Usage: py tools/test_extra_copy.py <scenario> [--slot N] [--env KEY=VALUE ...]

Scenarios:
  ship     save 45, warp into the ship fight (0x12/0x16 program 72), the host attacks for a while: no crash.
           No Sora copy is made there (the room spawns its own Sora, P_EX100_SIDECAR, not the PLAYER
           placeholder); both ways of adding one crashed (bench 2026-10-12 07:03 and 07:06, VERIFIED_OFFSETS).
  alone    the friend's game closes: the host sees the link lost, picks 'play on with Donald and Goofy'
           (debug link 3), reloads a room (no copy expected); the friend comes back and loads the
           same save: co-op again, the copy back in both games after the next room load.
  downed   god mode off. The friend's Sora takes a lethal hit (debug damage): down, not dead; then
           the host's too: both down = Game Over in both games.
  forms    the host goes into Valor Form (command menu: Drive, first form), then Reverts: the player
           switches bodies and back, the Sora copy stays in both games, no crash; then a room reload
           makes the copy again.
  limit    the host opens Limit (the command menu's second page) and uses the first Limit with the first partner;
           screenshot after each step; no crash, the copy still there after it.
  summon   the same with Summon (the first summon in the list).
  party    the command menu's Party entry: swap the first companion for the first one offered (a world ally,
           e.g. Auron in Olympus: --slot 14); then a room reload. No crash, the copy stays.
  xemnas   save 45, warp into Final Xemnas (0x12/0x14 program 74; --ship: through the ship-fight room first, as
           in play), Xemnas's HP set to 200 in both games, the host hits him: both games reach his grab
           (scene re_b_ex170-50) and still run 20 s later (session 28 two-PC run: both crashed there at
           exe+0x3D76DF, old method). Riku and the Sora copy both expected in both games.
  xlimit   Final Xemnas as above, then the host opens Limit (second menu page) and uses the first one.
  menu     opens the command menu's Drive entry on the host and takes screenshots (to find the
           Drive Form / Summon entries for the next scenarios).
Results: build/bench/extra_copy/<scenario>.txt and screenshots. PASS/FAIL exit code.
